## Managing Authentication Flows in Keycloak

Authentication flows in Keycloak define the steps a user goes through to authenticate with your application. This chapter will guide you through managing these flows programmatically using the provided Java tools and services.  Understanding this is crucial for controlling how your users access your realms and resources, tying in with concepts like **Realm Management**, **User Management**, and **Identity Provider Management**.

The `AuthenticationService` class provides core functionality for interacting with Keycloak's authentication flows, while the `AuthenticationTool` class exposes these functionalities as command-line tools.

### Listing Authentication Flows

To retrieve all authentication flows within a specific realm, use the `getAuthenticationFlows` method in `AuthenticationService`:

```java
public List<AuthenticationFlowRepresentation> getAuthenticationFlows(String realm) {
    try {
        return keycloak.realm(realm).flows().getFlows();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // ... error handling
    }
}
```

This method returns a list of `AuthenticationFlowRepresentation` objects, each representing a single flow.  You can access this functionality from the command line using the corresponding tool:

```bash
./kc-mcp-server authentication get-authentication-flows --realm myrealm
```
This command will return a JSON array representing all authentication flows in the "myrealm" realm.

### Retrieving a Specific Flow

To retrieve a specific authentication flow, use the `getAuthenticationFlow` method, providing both the realm and the flow's ID:

```java
public AuthenticationFlowRepresentation getAuthenticationFlow(String realm, String flowId) {
    try {
        return getAuthenticationFlows(realm).stream()
                .filter(flow -> flowId.equals(flow.getId()))
                .findFirst()
                .orElse(null);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // ... error handling
    }
}
```

Similarly, the command-line equivalent is:

```bash
./kc-mcp-server authentication get-authentication-flow --realm myrealm --flow-id <flowId>
```
Remember to replace `<flowId>` with the actual ID of the flow you want to retrieve.

### Creating a New Flow by Copying an Existing One

The provided code doesn't directly create flows from scratch, but offers a convenient way to copy an existing flow and then modify it:



```java
@Tool(description = "Create an authentication flow")
String createAuthenticationFlow(@ToolArg(description = "A String denoting the name of the realm") String realm,
                                @ToolArg(description = "A String denoting the the name of an authentication flow to copy") String authFlowNameId) {
    try {
        AuthenticationFlowRepresentation representation = authenticationService.getAuthenticationFlow(realm, authFlowNameId);
        representation.setId(null);
        representation.setAlias(authFlowNameId+"-copy");
        return authenticationService.createAuthenticationFlow(realm, representation);
    } catch (Exception e) {
         // ... error handling
    }
}
```

This tool copies an existing flow identified by `authFlowNameId`, sets a new alias and creates a new flow with the properties of the copied flow.

### Deleting an Authentication Flow

To delete a flow, use the `deleteAuthenticationFlow` method:

```java
public String deleteAuthenticationFlow(String realm, String flowId) {
    // ... implementation ...
}
```

The corresponding command-line tool is:

```bash
./kc-mcp-server authentication delete-authentication-flow --realm myrealm --flow-id <flowId>
```

### Managing Flow Executions

The code also provides functionality for managing flow executions, allowing you to inspect and modify the individual steps within a flow.  This involves `getFlowExecutions` and `updateFlowExecution` methods in the `AuthenticationService` and corresponding tools in  `AuthenticationTool`.

By understanding these building blocks, you can effectively manage your Keycloak authentication flows and tailor them to your specific application requirements.  As you progress, consider how **Authentication Flow Management** interacts with other key aspects of your Keycloak setup like **Client Management**, **Group Management**, and **Role Management** to define a complete security model.
